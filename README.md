# Chuck Norris Random Joke Generator

### Description

This app fetches random jokes from the [Chuck Norris Jokes API](https://api.chucknorris.io/)

### What I Learned

I learned about the XHR Object and how to use it to make HTTP requests. Normally, I would use the fetch API to make HTTP requests, but wanted to familiarize with this method of doing so.
